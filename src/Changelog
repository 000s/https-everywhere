0.2.0:
  * Work around the fact that Google does not allow client=firefox* HTTPS
    searches from outside the US, by rewriting those URIs
  * Add rules for:
    - Amazon
    - GMX
    - Live.com (Hotmail logins)
    - Meebo
    - the Netherlands Government
    - Wordpress.com
    - Zoho
  * Remove the assumption that non-US searches would always start with an hl=
    language parameter
  * Handle searches to the google.com/firefox script better
  * Remove accidental duplicates of a couple of rules!
  * Bump maxVersion into the future so we're compatible with Firefox alphas
  * Fix more legacy eff.org bugs

0.1.2:
  * Apparently, we are not actually compatible with Firefox 2.0.0.x, so don't
    install with it!
  * Further generalisation of Wikimedia rules
  * Fix bugs in the handling of obscure parts of eff.org and torproject.org
  * A bug in a user rules file should produce an error, rather than causing all
    rules to fail to load

0.1.1:
  * Generalise the Wikipedia rules to other Wikimedia services
  * In preferences window, add a link to instructions for writing one's own
    rules
