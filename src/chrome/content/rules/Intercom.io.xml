	This rule was automatically generated based on an HSTS
	preload rule in the Chromium browser.  See
	https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.h
	for the list of preloads.  Sites are added to the Chromium HSTS
	preload list on request from their administrators, so HTTPS should
	work properly everywhere on this site.

	Because Chromium and derived browsers automatically force HTTPS for
	every access to this site, this rule applies only to Firefox.

		- intercom-seminar.herokuapp.com

			- webinars

		- docs *
