<!--
        As of 2012-08-22, known unprotected subdomains are:
        - corp        (not listening on https)
        - blog        (not listening on https)
        - sites       (unbounce.com certificate)
        - advertising (unbounce.com certificate)
        - developer   (mashery.com certificate)
        - jobs        (theresumator.com certificate)
        - feedback    (uservoice.com certificate)

        However, there are tens (hundreds?) of subdomains supporting https with
        a wildcard certificate, so it's not worth whitelisting them one by one.

        Other related unprotected hosts:
        - chzb.gr
        - knowyourmeme.com

      There are some inconsistent redirects between cheezburger.com and
