<!--
	Problematic domains:

		- ^ ¹
		- www ¹
		- www.americanstandard ²
		- www.jabrapartner ²
		- www.pantone ²
		- www.plantronics ²

	¹: Refused
	²: Mismatch

	It would seem like all first level subdomains work, but that
	all others fail; if so, a wildcard rule would be more appropriate,
	but it is kept like this to be on the safe side.
