             * pixel.redditmedia.com - seems some sort of ad tracking, possibly can be sent to /dev/null; didn't find anything broken when I blocked the domain
             * www.redditmedia.com - seems only/mostly to be used for ads
             * s0.2mdn.net - has https, bad cert CN (not sure what this domain actually provides)
