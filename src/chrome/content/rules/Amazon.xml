<!--	This rule is off by default because it caused so many aspects of the
	Amazon site to break; see the mailing list archives for details.
	Currently being fixed...

	Amazon appears to operate in 7 countries, and does not hold the domains
	for some others, like .se or .be.  In other cases there is an http-only site
	that redirects to one of these 7 countries.


	amazon.com
		does work:
			ap/		(appears to be purchase-management related)
			([\w\-]+/)?dp/	(i.e., dp/ possibly preceeded by title)
			e/\w{10,10}/	(i.e., e/ followed by ASIN)

		doesn't work:
			$		(i.e., homepage)
			([\w\-]+/)?b/ 	(i.e., b/ preceeded by category)
			([\w\-]+/)?gp/	(i.e., gp/ possibly preceeded by title)
			Help/
			s/

	amazon.co.jp:
		does work:
			/ap/
			a few pages under gp/
		doesn't work:
			everything else

	amazon.cn:
		doesn't work:
			everything?

	amazon.*:
		does work:
			everything except...
		doesn't work:
			gp/search\?
			/mn/search/
			s/
			s\?rh=		(i.e., search pages and files)
